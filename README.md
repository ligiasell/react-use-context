# Jungle Devs - Frontend Challenge #004

  ## Description
  **Challenge goal**: The goal of this challenge is for you to organise your routes with Reach Router and use React Context API to have a global state and avoid prop drilling in complex scenarios. The challenge proposed is a very common issue in the web development world! Get ready!
  
  **Target level**: To tackle this challenge you must know how React states work, HTML, CSS and the idea is to familiarise yourself with Reach Router and Context API.
  
  **Final accomplishment**: By the end of this Hands-on youâ€™ll have a well organised route system to your website and global states defined by your Context API. Your component will be able to update based on this state and your page will have a different behaviour according to the route the user is in.
